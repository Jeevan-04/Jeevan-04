### About

I am a computer science undergraduate, currently learning and exploring
how computational systems reason, how uncertainty can be represented
explicitly, and how limits of knowledge can be respected.

My interests include symbolic and epistemic reasoning, systems programming,
and studying knowledge traditions as structured methods of inquiry rather
than belief systems.

My work is exploratory and evolving. I value careful thinking, discussion,
correction, and collaboration.

### Areas of Interest

- Symbolic and epistemic reasoning  
- Reasoning systems that can express uncertainty or refusal  
- Deterministic and auditable execution for AI systems  
- Systems programming (primarily C++)  
- Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS), approached critically and text-first

### Projects

| Project | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [Epistemic Reasoning Core](https://github.com/Jeevan-04/epistemic-reasoning-core) | A symbolic reasoning project exploring uncertainty, justification, and refusal as part of reasoning. Ongoing learning-oriented work. |
| [Invariant](https://github.com/Jeevan-04/Invariant) | An experimental execution framework exploring how LLMs can be treated as untrusted compute with enforced runtime constraints. |
| [cpp-notebook](https://github.com/Jeevan-04/cpp-notebook) | A native C++ notebook-style environment for exploratory computation, inspired by Jupyter but designed for C++. |
| [Nirukti](https://nirukti.org) | A long-term project focused on Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS), emphasizing primary texts, sources, and slow inquiry. |
| [Mahabharata (experimental)](https://github.com/Jeevan-04/Mahabharata_V0.1) | Early experimental work exploring text modeling using classical literature. |

### Writing and Logs

I maintain notes, essays, and project logs on my personal site:

https://jeevan-04.github.io

This includes design notes, reflections, and records of changes made over time.

### Notes

- I am still learning and refining my ideas.  
- I value clarity over speed and depth over volume.  
- I am open to discussion, feedback, and collaboration.
