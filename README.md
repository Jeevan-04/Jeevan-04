### About

I am a computer science undergraduate interested in how computational systems represent knowledge, handle uncertainty, and behave under constraints.

I am particularly drawn to problems where reasoning breaks down - where systems must decide whether to proceed, defer, or refuse.

### Areas of Interest

My interests tend to cluster around the following themes:
- Symbolic and epistemic reasoning  
- Reasoning systems that can express uncertainty or refusal  
- Deterministic and auditable execution for AI systems  
- Systems programming (primarily C++)  
- Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS), approached critically and text-first

### Projects

My interests tend to cluster around the following themes:


| Project | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [Epistemic Reasoning Core](https://github.com/Jeevan-04/epistemic-reasoning-core) | A symbolic reasoning project exploring uncertainty, justification, and refusal as part of reasoning. Ongoing learning-oriented work. |
| [Invariant](https://github.com/Jeevan-04/Invariant) | An experimental execution framework exploring how LLMs can be treated as untrusted compute with enforced runtime constraints. |
| [cpp-notebook](https://github.com/Jeevan-04/cpp-notebook) | A native C++ notebook-style environment for exploratory computation, inspired by Jupyter but designed for C++. |
| [Nirukti](https://nirukti.org) | A long-term project focused on Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS), emphasizing primary texts, sources, and slow inquiry. |
| [Mahabharata (experimental)](https://github.com/Jeevan-04/Mahabharata_V0.1) | Early experimental work exploring text modeling using classical literature. |

### Writing and Logs

I maintain notes, essays, and project logs on my personal site:

https://jeevan-04.github.io

This includes design notes, reflections, and records of changes made over time.

### Notes

- I am still learning and refining my ideas.  
- I value clarity over speed and depth over volume.  
- I am open to discussion, feedback, and collaboration.
